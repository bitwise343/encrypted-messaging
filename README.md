# encrypted-messaging

Welcome to encrypted messaging. This is a simple Python GUI coded using the 
PyQt5 module. It takes a string and encrypts it using AES. The key must be
added into the code in order for it work, currently. Eventually, the key itself
will be stored in an encrypted file. For now, it is the way it is.
